## Hi there 👋

I'm a 3D Generalist who mostly does 2D/3D concept art and builds tools to make my life easier, then share them when they might help others. 

Most of my repos are personal tools, learning projects, or experiments that grew into something useful.

## What I Do

I create 2d/3d concept art, animations, vfx and develop tools to make my creative work more efficient and less repetative.

**3D & Environments**  
From concept to final render, I work across the full 3D pipeline—modeling, texturing, environments, and visualization.
